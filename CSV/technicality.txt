@jackmcdade @RBC (The typical way to send money within Canada is interac email transfer, which is pretty instant, and usually free.)
@jackmcdade I don't know, but I'm willing to be a test subject. You can test different ways of sending me money.If you open up a US bank account and a Canadian bank account at @RBC you could transfer the money from USA to Canada, then email the money to the Canadian recipient.
@RBC if I have a business account with multiple signers, can one of those signers visit the branch and close the account without the signature or authorization of the other signers?
@aidaML_ @RBC I was so impressed with the paperless part!
Hi @RBC! Just went to my home branch and loving the new ATMs with *tap* for single transactions and more importantly the envelope-free deposits!
@RBC - Can you fix your mobile cheque deposit algorithm, it's really terrible and was way better before you decide to get subpar developers to change the code to this garbage code.  Everytime I try to image a cheque it keeps asking to go closer or dark background or flip over.
Is https://t.co/rz9J3p7JdN down? I can't seem to login @RBC @AskRBC
@RBC there seems to be a #wording issue with the #mobilebankingapp https://t.co/sCQRy7a4RX
.@RBC It's 2020, can I have MFA now?
@RBC telebanking needs to be redesigned. waste of time
@RBC why, why, why, on the APP is the only option for contact making an appointment? Their is a phone symbol on the tab, but appointment offered only, no phone number. I do not need an appointment to ask a question about a deposit to my account ðŸ¤¦ï¿½ï¿½â™€ï¿½ What am I missing?
@RBC @AskRBC @interac I love #autodeposit and all. But... can we have the sendersâ€™ names back so that we can have proper #bookkeeping??? #Accounting https://t.co/4DAEnhIDwj
@RBC how can I report an issue with my RBC branch?Please confirm me as I am sick and tired of them giving wrong commitments initially while signing up.
Hey @RBC how exactly can I get my REWARDS when your system won't allow bookings? Already missed out on a flight. Get your sh*t together. Not acceptable! https://t.co/tBk4ZerCkk
@RBC are your phone lines down? i've been trying to contact you on various phone numbers and even tried requesting a call back, but I can never get put through to someone. extremely frustrating.
What is the point of purchasing travel cancellation insurance if you can't cancel your flight when civil unrest breaks out?? You want me to bring my kid into violent protests for vacation? Not ok @RBC @AskRBC
@BMO How long is your average telephone wait time, guys? @ScotiabankHelps @CIBC @td_canada @RBC
@RBC the online banking sign-in page has a "service notice" section but it does not mention the wire transfer service outage (confirmed via telephone). It would be nice if it did so I'd know when it was fixed.
@colinbowern @RBC I had that with TD; ended up digging out an old cell that I could install the app on and use over wifi. :/
Hey ï¿½@RBCï¿½ can you open up your mobile banking app so I can get it in NZ? I have accounts back home in Canada but canâ€™t get to the app on my mobile which is tied to NZ. The web view on mobile is half baked. https://t.co/ID6Som146c
Why is there no way to call the specific @RBC branch I want... Wtf
@AskRBC @RBC Good afternoon, I have been locked out of my online banking for some time now. I would like to fix it so I can get into my online banking. Can you help with that please and thank you ?
@RBC any plans to update rbc direct investing iphone app? It lacks behind rbc app really bad. Unsure if rbc DI has a twitter account either
@RBC Mobile App on IPhone down again ! Has been for past week now ! How much longer
@RBC  Account login showing transactions date as Jan 06, 2020 (in Future) for today's transaction.!!!!! https://t.co/jPocI0NJBI
Hey @RBC I get this message twice a week. I'm running out of password options. Why? https://t.co/xxTRj0mCd8
#FlashbackFriday To the time I had a drink ðŸ¥ƒ with the Vice-President of Processing Systems @RBC Jim Grant in the lounge at Toronto airport. This memorable event came about at the end of a work day. First thing in the morning of that day myself along with Glen who had been /1
I have a Tuesday morning appointment with @RBC I worked hard to pay off my two credit cards last year. I hope we can plan out something to tackle the rest of my debt.
@MdNtTkr @doughoyes @ScottTerrioHMA @TD_Canada @RBC Still has some room to play with toggling between credit cards for a few more months before settling on a proposal.
@NotTheseDroids @Brendone5 @Money777Too @TD_Canada @fidelitycanada @TD_DirectInvest @RBC Should also mention they were very transparent from the get go, offered to investigate n kept me in the loop the entire time. Got an email with account update, checked my RBC app and there my shares were sitting ready to trade. Of all the big banks, definitely recommend RBC DIï¿½
@NotTheseDroids @Brendone5 @Money777Too @TD_Canada @fidelitycanada @TD_DirectInvest It's been sloppy from the get go but kudos to @RBC Direct Investing for having shares in accounts no more than a day after the smaller merchants. Might I recommend RBC DI to you @Brendone5
Going to see @rickygervais in August thanks to @RBC customer perksðŸ‘Œï¿½
@stitchlady @ellenroseman That would set a dangerous precedent. Think about all those with the "me, too" mentality! The decision by @RBC was the correct one.
@stevemcniven @TD_Canada @RBC I do respect rbc. Unfortunately when my Father passed away I had to utilize TD in order to settle his estate. Regardless of funds &amp; investments I am still treated like a pauper. The worst is the inconsistent responses from employees.
@shannon_1977 @TD_Canada We just deposited a large cheque to SAVINGS, they told us 5 business day hold, but we did it on a friday, so itâ€™d take TEN business days for some reason. Then they put the hold on the CHEQUING account instead locking us out of our debit cards.Switch banks, @RBC was REALLY good
@perrybellegarde @BMO Iâ€™ll be moving my money out of BMO screw you guys Iâ€™m going to @RBC
@TD_Canada We just found out at our meeting with @RBC about switching off @TD_Canada that you guys set us up with a garbage loc at double the regular rate, and told us it was a great one.So to anyone reading this, don't trust your 'financial confidence' to TD.TD only cares about TD
@CBCAlerts @bmo I will be switching to @RBC after this despicable act
@katebriggsprice @RBC Itâ€™s literally the best pen ever
@JennyPagliuca @RBC I appreciate this commitment
@TD_Canada @bel4_20 We know you aren't supporting it every time we look at the app and think, "dafuq?!" The question isn't "are you supporting Google Pay?" The question is "WHY AREN'T YOU SUPPORTING GOOGLEPAY?!"@RBC ... How hard is it to move my money to you? Do you have Visa Debit?
@GPStorm @RBC @TheAJHL Love the â€˜Bank of Mom and Dadâ€™ ðŸ’™ my kid is a loyal â€˜customerâ€™ of that organization ðŸ¤¨ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
@RBC What's RBC Rewards point?
@RBC Would they find it strange if I just walked into the office and asked for a pen? Would have to be the next time Iâ€™m in London!
@AH__Jon @TD_Canada @GooglePay @Google I started the fucking thing and I give up... moving to @RBC this week. They're making it easy, I'll document and post the steps... and update the petition notes for others to see and switch too, nice work @TD_Canada  Lets see how many people we can get moved
@LoganAusmus @TD_Canada https://t.co/h7KQRoXEM7 PetitionYeah, I have an appointment with @RBC tomorrow to see how we can get off @TD_Canada as soon as possible,
Hi @RBC this is weird but I got this pen from you at a careers fair in Southampton ages ago and itâ€™s my absolute favourite pen to write with. Sadly this pen has now run out, heartbroken ðŸ’” can you please tell me if itâ€™s possible to get another pen somewhere? Maybe your supplier? https://t.co/f7tuGfswO2
@RBC Hello,  my son who is 16 is interested in the eSavings High Interest account. He already has a youth account. Is there a minimum age for this account?
@TD_Canada Why is your bank so slow at distributing spin out shares of $ZEU? Many banks have already distributed including @RBC  Your bank is one of the last to the show. Might be time to switch banks.
@CJusticeTO @350 @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Thank you
@CJusticeTO @MaryJLovell @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC ðŸ˜Š
@CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC yes!!!âœŠï¿½
@CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Way to go!!
@itstommygabriel @RBC @AskRBC Thank you for the additional @ good sir.
@RBC who do I send fraud ( phishing) texts to?
@mattblaismusic @RBC I showed this to my mom because she works in their digital marketing department
@Paul8rown @WilliamsRacing @RBC They have another rich Canadian
@MdNtTkr @ScottTerrioHMA @TD_Canada @RBC ...I never said they don't have sales targets....Also, when did Fairstone loan them money?  I assume they are maxed out at TD.You are correct.  The cash flow math doesn't work.
@failb8 @RBC @RBC even had the audacity to claim that they "didn't have the reserve to reimburse" the fraudulent debt....such liars!!!!!
@RBC made 12.9 billion in 2019. RBC has the worst support team. I couldn't even get reimbursed for a double charge that put me $10 in overdraft about a year ago. Was on hold with "fraud" for over an hour.This is why I don't bank with them anymore and never will in the future. https://t.co/ObLDq2b0j9
@RBC hi when i call your support services to get help i expect at least bare minimum human decency instead of being treated like a fraud for my own bank account and then being hung up on
Bring back assumable mortgages, so those facing the loss of a home may try to sell it! @BMO @cibc @RBC @ServusCU
Also, @jkenney could sell off the ATB. Competing with the private sector is idiotic. @BMO @cibc @RBC @ServusCU
@sorhay_posada @ringerzinger1 @BlackburnSarnia @mjarlette @MsAmyMacPherson @FINRA @RBC @TDAmeritrade @TDAmeritradePR @KKR_Co @PwC @PwC_Canada @BioAmber Exactly.  We are the shareholders
@ringerzinger1 @BlackburnSarnia @mjarlette @MsAmyMacPherson @FINRA @RBC @TDAmeritrade @TDAmeritradePR @KKR_Co @PwC @PwC_Canada @BioAmber We know this was not some blatantly fraudulent deal. The share purchase is coming, no doubt about it IMO. However we are tired of being held hostage and are rightfully owed some sort of communication now $bioaq
@BMO @RBC @TD_Canada @scotiabank @atbandre @FirstCalgary do better. take action. enough learning, time to show you care about indigenous peoples via action.if it wouldn't happen to white people doing the same, its racial profiling.
@MdNtTkr @doughoyes @TD_Canada @RBC Banks are businesses. And businesses sell stuff. Then they play the odds.
@sorhay_posada @ringerzinger1 @BlackburnSarnia @mjarlette @MsAmyMacPherson @FINRA @RBC @TDAmeritrade @TDAmeritradePR @KKR_Co @PwC @PwC_Canada @BioAmber Enough is enough
What is up with these banks?  What a BS excuse not to cover the losses related to bank card theft. Shame oN @RBC to penalize a student when you have Video evidence of the criminal using her card. You are disgusting
@doughoyes @ScottTerrioHMA What's wrong with this picture? Combined income UNDER 95k. Don't tell me @TD_Canada @RBC don't have 'sales' targets. But but but what about the shareholders and our billion dollar profits ðŸ‘€ Guess where this file is headed? https://t.co/Kcsus1pDHJ

@KKR_Co @mjarlette @PwC_Canada @PwC @MsAmyMacPherson @MSNBC @RBC approaching 2 months now. https://t.co/IDFeLZCjQL
The same thing happened to me and Iâ€™m also an @RBC client. Iâ€™m so disappointed to hear that someone else is experiencing this as well. Iâ€™m also disappointed with how RBC handled my particular situation and Iâ€™m lucky to have caught it sooner than 2 weeks. https://t.co/58MIIBdRkC
@briangm11 @ellenroseman @RBC I agree with you but I do feel sorry for this girl. They could quietly reimburse her as a gesture of good will.
@RBC what an absolute scam you guys are pulling here. she reported the theft of her card but you continued to give the thief access to her account and now you want her to pay for it? people with RBC should look to another bank quicklyhttps://t.co/Y2HOyLnqF4
Maybe if @RBC allowed PINs longer than 4 digits, stealing PINs would be more difficult. There are only 10,000 permutations of 4 digit PINs (using 0 to 9), whereas 6 digits would allow for up to a million different PINs. https://t.co/YtAIDsPbpK
Shame on you, @rbc. Canadians expect much better from our banks who are financially well off and better able to deal with fraud. You make Billions. Don't ruin this student's life! CTV News: Student scammed $8000 won't be reimbursed b/c used phone # PIN.https://t.co/WkOulJKCqp
@CTVNews @RBC  pls gives the student back her money ... Its$8000 that's nothing to u #bigbank but the student should not have overdraft of 8000 that's too much tho
@CKNW Been having @BMO problems since switching my mortgage over to them last year. BS extra fees ect that even staff said get waved for new customers usally. I got absolutely zero appreciation or perks for moving my 500k mortgage to them from @RBC. Now I read this and BS. Im done.
@RBC @AskRBC reports profit in the billions each year. expect a student to pay 8k after being a victim of fraud is absolutely disgraceful. #dotherightthing @PatForanCTVNews
@RBC @RBC  I demand answers and repercussions for the discriminatory behavior of the staff there. @bmo is already on the news for same settlement.  I had my account frozen with my settlement because they thought it was fraud.  I'm first nations and also with the heiltsuk nation
@RBC you guys at the clayton heights branch have done the same actions as @BMO . I was given a settlement through heiltsuk band and I was using my money no problem until I went in person to withdraw cash.  No policy on holds for direct deposit I looked.
@JaimeJiggs @BMO @RBC @Banque_TD @cibc @CBCIndigenous To say nothing of a police force that would handcuff a 12 year old girl.  What a life changing moment for her......
@JaimeJiggs @BMO @RBC @Banque_TD @cibc @CBCIndigenous @BMO Suggest committing to have all your staff (management and Board included) complete accredited Indigenous Cultural Safety training.This can be a learning moment for your corporation.
@CINetwork2019 @RBC If banks didn't enjoy the luxury of an oligopoly then they'd be singing a different tune.Banks and telcos, the true thieves of Canadian consumers
Student scammed $8,000 won't be reimbursed because she used phone number digits as PIN@RBC, so let's get this straight first you f***** over your insurance customers, and now you're f****** over banking customers for your own mistake. #boycottrbc https://t.co/LI3tP7SCkq
Hey @RBC, your cust service representatives at 1-877-769-2547 call often, leave no voicemail &amp; asked for a whole lot of personal info when I called them back. A quick Google search makes the number look illegitimate. What's the deal?
@BMO is trash and should fire their employee that called the cops on a 12 year old native girl. She was handcuffed and detained due to this employee! Close your accounts and switch to @RBC
@wef @RBC What silly denialism. Four of these skills will be automated with relative ease over this decade. And the automation of critical thinking will be a hotly pursued goal for leading tech companies.
@stevemcniven @TD_Canada @RBC I had them pursue me for a credit card acct that i never opened twenty years ago for 200 lousy bucks. They put me in collections,didnt even know it until it screwed up my first car loan at 13.99%, i asked what the hell was up / they said it was TD failure. Students run far away!!
Oh @RBC. Why do you never have enough tellers on. Last week there was only two tellers on wait time over 20 mins. This week 12 people in line and two tellers. Seriously disappointing.
WTF. Not like the scammer knew her phone number. Shady AF @RBC https://t.co/vlNEYm2XAO
@CTVToronto Shame on you @RBC !!!
@RBC had the worst service at the call center ... patronizing and rude ... all I wanted was to know where to call to add a person to be able to deposit cheques into my account.. over the past few months seeing the worst RBC behaviour ... I had mortgage.. loc....closing all
Hey @RBC, why is it the very few times I come into a branch I have easily to wait 20-30 minutes before being seen? I asked other patrons in line and they all expressed similar experiences. Is this a common bank experience or just an RBC experience?
@GLOBE_Series @globeandmail @RBC @IKEACanada @MGerbis @WWFCanada @CaGBC @FIAFormulaE @MapleLeafFoods @Delphi_Group @CUTRIC_CRITUC @xprize Visit: https://t.co/LOime6lHjz https://t.co/sQlnzeeHvi   @VenAmericaMag1/@GpoVenAmericahttps://t.co/hjSr3x5xLM
@RBC again. This set up is horrible. No business tellers and there is always a lineup with 2-3 people actually working. Who ever approved these changes needs to be fired. Need to do business, not stand in line for 30 min 3 times a week https://t.co/l7BDW4qrUQ
Let this not happen @TD_Canada @RBC @cibc @scotiabank @atbfinancial  @ServusCU  or ever again at @BMO! Looking back on my privilege, in the same situation, never got questioned, 12 yr old was not scarred for life. #bebetter https://t.co/B8lFqwQVlo

@Joyhenderson78 @RBC Joy, that is horrifying. I am so sorry that happened to you.
He told me that they had to be sure that there was no fraud (in front of my 13 year old who blurted out â€œexcuse me???ï¿½) I asked him point blank, if he would be asking these questions if I were white. (He was S. Asian) and he finally backed off. Thanks @RBC.
@RBC @AirCanada booked flights over Xmas on RBCrewards, had to cancel. $610/passenger. Using credit: +$200 penalty + fare diff. Flight mid Jan now addâ€™l $120 ON TOP of penalty. Your adv. is false. Your fares and treatment of customers is catpoo. Now 15000 pts +$950 to fly yvr-yyc
@RBC denied my $1250 from a fraud claim. Iâ€™m Switching banks, astounding that for â€œknowingï¿½ of my problem two days before i noticed, its insane to me they never ONCE called me until it was too late. Claiming it was my fault. Fam, my money was not secured. Unacceptable.
So I was on hold with @RBC for an hour and when I finally speak to someone the guys like I canâ€™t hear you call the number on the back of your card ???? tf you heard me ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚
Donâ€™t bank with @RBC !!! They are the worseeeee bank
@RBC @CJusticeTO @JustinTrudeau @jjhorgan  I'm closing my accounts and moving to a credit union.  I'll be done by the end of the month.  Not going to do business with a bank that finances the destruction of our collective future.  Ashamed of my home province and country https://t.co/Qfk3Dnza7i
@KellyRichmondBC @RBC @cibc @TD_Canada @CarolDayRmd @bogberry @Harold_Steves Use a credit union. Try VanCity.
@Rodney_Mercer @TD_Canada That exactly what @RBC and @scotiabank did to our family. Do people actually think they dont meet at top levels to find new ways to part people from their money?  Thry post massive profits annually on backs of mom and pop business and joe and jane public. ever see 5% credit card?
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC I donâ€™t say it, the Constitution says it :)
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC See, now you're in "a lot has changed since 1763" mode.  It's pretty darn hypocritical to say "the 1763 proclamation is what we go by! Period."...then revise it as you see fit based upon what Canada (do you call them settlers or colonists again?) did in the intervening years...
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Nope. Sec. 25 says "any rights or freedoms that have been recognized by the Royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763".  That includes the HBC, no?.  It's in the proclamation.
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Oh and HBC sold its land to Canada in 1867. Most of BC was not part of that sale.
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC The Charter settled that.
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC India had an overwhelmingly larger population that gave them an advantage.
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC That doesn't seem fair. King George III's document that you say holds precedent gave the land to HBC.  So only some of the document is valid?  Which parts?  Who decides?
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC The FN didnâ€™t have the opportunity to take back their country like the Indians did because they were decimated by smallpox (given infected blankets) and then herded onto residential schools.
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC So the land shown on the map belongs to HBC?  For keeps?
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Yes. And as there was existing title on Wetâ€™suwetâ€™en lands at the time of HBC contact, they couldnâ€™t claim rights to that land.
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Juuuust as soon as you actually read the proclamation you're so fond of.   Do you agree with the whole thing? https://t.co/PeJi27qeNo
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Interestingly it WAS an HBC trader who first came in contact with the Wetâ€™suwetâ€™en and wrote back to his superiors that the Wetâ€™suwetâ€™en has a Title System which was unique for FN at that time.
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Lol this was fun but Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Constitution Act 1984) Section 25 READ IT.
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC So HBC is in!  Woohoo!
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Section 25 of the Charter guaranteesâ€œany rights or freedoms that have been recognized by the Royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763ï¿½
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC I see the gap:  you're reading an interpretation of the document, while posted a link to the actual words.  Read the words and think for yourself.  Or is that not a UBC thing?
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Bubba, bubba, reeeead your own link. https://t.co/wu9myCt6SI
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC That's the link I posted.  So help me understand:  does the Indigenous claim equal the HBC claim?  Or do you feel George meant one more than the other? Because I fail to see how you can cherry-pick bits of a 257 year old document with a straight face.  All or nothing?
@fireballka7 @RBC @TDAmeritrade @Fidelity @etrade @MsAmyMacPherson @cnnbrk @SeekingAlpha Figure it out kitten. Only people that need to see this tweet are tagged and they know that the walls are caving in. @PwC   @PwCUS @PwC_Canada @MsAmyMacPherson @mjarlette
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Lololol. You didnâ€™t even read your own link. I just copied and pasted from what you sent and sent it back to you. ðŸ˜‚
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Wrong again.  I gave you a link.  Why won't you read it?
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Here is my Alma Mater to further explain it to you. Interesting how youâ€™re caught up on the corporate bit ðŸ¤‘https://t.co/wu9myCt6SI
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC In the Royal Proclamation, ownership over North America is issued to King George. However, the Royal Proc explicitly states that Aboriginal title has existed and continues to exist, and that all land would be considered Aboriginal land until ceded by treaty.
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Not really. You ought to actually read it.  Especially since you're attempting to be a twitter expert on the thing.  My fave part is the HBC bit.  Who knew they have the rights to all that land!!  I'll make a mint from my shares!
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC It forbade all settlement west of a line drawn along the Appalachian Mountains.
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC I did read it. It's right here.  clearly you have not?https://t.co/GVBe1RAv4E
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Reeeeead the document it clearly demarcated boundaries that have nothing to do with the HBC. Please reaaad and the re-read and then get a map and look at the settler boundaries.
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Or is only some of King George III's proclamation still valid? The bits you like, but not the rest?
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC But it says HBC right in the same paper you believe is the precedent for everything else!  Have you seen what they got??  "within the limits of the Territory granted to the Hudsonâ€™s Bay Company". Look! https://t.co/gP73W167TX
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC A corporate mentality I see. A tip,  countries are not corporations.
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Not at all.  'Nuff said.  I mean, what's really changed since 1763?  But that reminds me I should buy some shares in the Hudson's Bay Company, since they're mentioned prominently in the declaration as well!
@RBC do tell us about that check........$bioaq https://t.co/cCbDfHRmhQ
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Yes, and do you know the English still hold up the Magna Carta as the Principles of the Westminster Parliamentary System? Or are you a corporate clown that thinks countries have no history?
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Thanks for the clarification! You should have just said "because King George III said so!" Consider me convinced!
Really @RBC ? You going to accidentally hit someone with a $bioaq distribution and not provide details? @TDAmeritrade @Fidelity @etrade @MsAmyMacPherson @cnnbrk @SeekingAlpha
Ay @mjarlette @PwC @PwC_Canada you boys want to provide an honst update or are you ready for some more fraud accusations on your record? @MsAmyMacPherson @cnnbrk @OPP_News @Canada @SeekingAlpha @TDAmeritrade @RBC donâ€™t forget about the distribution you havenâ€™t provided detailsfor
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Iâ€™ll explain it simply for you. Wetâ€™suwetâ€™en have always had a title system to their lands. Royal Proclamation 1763 tells SETTLERS to stay off. Charter Sec. 25 guarantees Royal Proc. Delgamuukw reaffirms. No need to compromise further to Settler court whims
@dirteafairy @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC What a coincidence!! Until you give the land upon which you live back to the indigenous peoples who were there before you, I'm laughing at your hypocrisy!
@RBC @cibc @TD_Canada @CarolDayRmd @bogberry @Harold_Steves Itâ€™s time to stop betting against ourselves and move our money away from new fossil fuel developments.

@CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Lock them up and throw away the key.
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Here is the lawyer who won Delgamuukw to explain it to you. Donâ€™t worry, he uses small words so youâ€™ll understand.https://t.co/py4vOXx6FQ
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Royal Proclamation 1763 is enshrined in Article 25 of the Charter.
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC What authority does the settler state court have to order anything on unceded traditional territory?
Ready for fun-very windy week @SonyOpenHawaii ! Letâ€™s Go!!!  @UnitedRentals @unisyscorp @RBC @JaniKingTowel @JaniKingClean @ThriveHiveSE @Titleist @projock https://t.co/9pMlN45Gyj
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC No. https://t.co/hEAieBvocL
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC There hasnâ€™t been one Bubba. They donâ€™t need to prove â€œTitleï¿½ itâ€™s already been proved that they have it and itâ€™s never been extinguished.
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC That page doesn't reference the new trial.  Not sure why you linked it?
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC No.https://t.co/Q3g8TCoc81
@Marinasarr @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Afraid not. The new trial is required to "determine whether Aboriginal title had been established for these lands".  Which kinda sorta sounds like the whole crux of the issue.
@Bubbafett33 @ChadRoberts529 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC They established that existing Title hadnâ€™t been ceded. Thatâ€™s the only thing they needed to do. They donâ€™t owe the colonial courts anymore. Nice try though.
@1Bob_Chamberlin BREAKING: In case you missed it, 29 youth just occupied the offices of the prime financiers of the $6.6 billion Coastal GasLink (CGL) pipeline in Toronto, in solidarity with Wet'suwet'en against a colonial invasion. CC: @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC.
@ChadRoberts529 @Marinasarr @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Looks like even fewer know a new trial was called for Delgamuukw v British Columbia, leaving the hereditary leaders with no legal leg to stand on. But super good try!
@CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Translation.  Arrogant whitesplaining racist eco activists undermine elected First Nations Chief and Council.  The great (racist) white eco mother knows best.
@CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Translation - White eco activists put First Nations elected chief and council  in their place. The great white (racist) eco earth mother has spoken.
@CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC What makes you think you can speak for the Wetsuweten? What you are doing is oppression.

@AskRBC Great- I look forward to seeing a significant change in your packaging efforts ie. little to no and compostable  packaging if necessary. @RBC  Try to show your customers you care about our climate crisis please.
@CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Iâ€™m sure this will change so much.
@Marinasarr @CJusticeTO @Bubbafett33 @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Also, #UNDRIP has been passed in BC
@CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC The elected band leaders all support this project. Donâ€™t believe this propaganda. Itâ€™s only the hereditary chiefs, who are not elected and many say are corrupted, that oppose this safe project that would bring good jobs and prosperity to remote indigenous communities.
@theurbangeog @UnistotenCamp @TD_Canada @RBC Never thought I'd be hopeful they'd follow the lead of Goldman-Sachs on a project like this, https://t.co/FOEKAVcsUi
@markyeg @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC For what?
@CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC AIMco = also corp managing Alberta teachers' pension fund (deferred wages) after Bill 22 transferred funds from corp teachers could still influence to one over which they have no control, one which = likely to use $$$ to subsidize fossil fuel extraction:https://t.co/OKKjuUcMmc
@RBC the worst customer service Iâ€™ve experienced as a 15 years persona and business client. I wish this was the first time but unfortunately it is not.  A flight through RBC Rewards, flight is double the price in comparison to what both United and Air Canada offer! Unacceptable!
@CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Careful now, youâ€™re in Ontario. The last PC guv shot and killed a FN man for standing up. Itâ€™s how things are done here.
@CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Hope they get arrested.
@CJusticeTO @Marinasarr @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Fundamentally, you need to figure out who has the decision rights. Is it a group of people elected by the people? Or someone whose great great great grandfather held a position of power within the tribe?  Iâ€™ll take the former.
@Marinasarr @Bubbafett33 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC 5 people have total say and not the will of the elected councils. Seems about right.
@CJusticeTO @Bubbafett33 @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC ...and the Stateâ€™s been beaten in their own colonial courts on this one! Their own colonial document restrains their settlers from unceded lands - Royal Proclamation 1763 and enshrined in Canadian Charter Sec. 25
@Marinasarr @Bubbafett33 @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC This^. And the difference is that the Queen of England is literally a colonizer and has no jurisdiction or power on sovereign indigenous lands (see: entire history of British empire), while Wetâ€™suwetâ€™en hereditary chiefs and their people have a right to self-determination.
In solidarity with @UnistotenCamp from Toronto's financial district, headquarters of @TD_Canada / @RBC -- financiers of the pipeline running through Wet'suwet'en lands https://t.co/vmQPlpSjj8
@Bubbafett33 @CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Just to help you out. Elected leaders have no say on the territory, only inside their  tiny rez. Authority for what happens on unceded land rest with Hereditary Chiefs. Delgamuukw v The Queen 1997. #Wetsuwetenstrong
@CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Iâ€™m sure they are scared shitless of you.
@CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Except all the elected leaders approve of the project. If you see hereditary leaders as having that much clout, Iâ€™m assuming youâ€™d like the Queen of England to make decisions on Canadaâ€™s behalf?
@CJusticeTO @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC thank you very much for leadership!
@RBC stop investing in genocide. Indigenous sovereignty is #climatejustice. Toronto Solidarity with #unistoten. #wetsuwetenstrong https://t.co/y3I9wmn6tn
@jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC The choice facing RBC &amp; its CEO, David McKay, is clear: either you extend your support for this brutal colonial invasion, or you withdraw your involvement from this project NOW. If you donâ€™t, know that you have an entire generation to contend with. #WetsuwetenStrong #Unistoten https://t.co/FYSfEqOT6d
@jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC RBC, headquartered here, serves as the exclusive financial advisor to the CGL pipeline. This means that RBC is responsible for and complicit in: fossil fuel extraction, man camps that lead to MMIWG, desecration of sacred burial grounds, violence on unceded Indigenous lands. https://t.co/rwU9urwrlT
@jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh @RBC Young people from CJTO &amp; Rising Tide TO took over the offices the RBC, AIMco, and paid a visit to TC Energy. As major financiers of CGL, these corporations must divest a pipeline on Wet'suwet'en territory, from a colonial invasion by the RCMP, &amp; fossil fuels. #WetsuwetenStrong https://t.co/J0jrGcmJKM

My worse nightmare right now is @RBC! More than one month waiting for an international transfer to be effective. The investigation indicates that the delay is @RBC fault... but gets worse: Any federal agencies in Canada could offer me help to claim asap respond!!!
@_saraorrico @RBC After being on hold for 10 minutes I got an answer to the general phone line and then they transferred me to the @RBC branch and there was no answer and the inbox was full. Like, why can't I call DIRECTLY the branch I need?
@cibc @TD_Canada @RBC #boycottthebigbanks and switch to @TangerineBank
This is an absurd amount of packaging and paper for 1 plastic card @RBC . Shame on your sustainability efforts! Please find a more sustainable way to provide your customers with their cards. https://t.co/bOxb9dz1vX
The @RBC made $12.4 Billion in 2018, yet they have the worst customer service on the planet. "All of our representatives are busy, please stay on the line..." Give customers what they want not what you think they need.
@xRebelCanada @RBC Switch to a local credit union.
@chelseacriddell @RBC Very -_- had to hold up the line to transfer money from a different account.
@djoanxo @RBC Annoying.
Since when does @RBC put a hold on cash deposits?
@RBC to fund the tarsands, fracked gas, coal mines, pipelines, industrial animal agriculture etc that are driving this climate chaos and planetary ecological collapse./end rant
And after you donate to people who need it in Australia maybe we should stop at the nearest branch of @RBC, ask to see the manager and demand to know how it is that they (and the rest of the axis of evil Canadian banks) can live with themselves while  they continue ...1 https://t.co/7q1nWmHaN5
Everyone is a scammer, including all the big banks in Canada @TD_Canada @cibc @RBC @scotiabank explain why you all charge $7 and change for money order that's supposed to be the equivalent of money, but still want to hold it for 5 to 7 days like regular cheques? This must STOP
@rbc @scotiabank @cibc @TDBank_US @BMO @nationalbank @CitibankOil companies are constructing pipelines and risking oil spills on Indigenous territories and violating Indigenous rights. Donâ€™t fund these devastating projects! #StolenLand
@jesshousty @rjjago @RBC @scotiabank @BMO @TD_Canada The bank has no heart, just a vault.
@RBC how is it that Ive been in branch twice, had to open a new account specifically for this and move all my banking to the new account, THEN had to call because you didn't change the autowithdrawl to account you forced me to open and you STILL haven't moved the autowithdrawl
.@RBC get yâ€™all fraud department to fix they attitudes or Iâ€™m scamming yâ€™all outta 20 bands on Christ https://t.co/RbhNcswKvq
@rjjago @RBC @scotiabank @BMO @TD_Canada The police apologized (after the artist managed to reach a community advocate at home who explained the situation by phone). The bank did not apologize. The artist has a pre-existing panic disorder that heâ€™s openly shared has relapsed hard since the incident. /3
@rjjago @RBC @scotiabank @BMO @TD_Canada Assuming his status card was a fake and that the recent deposit was due to a scam heâ€™d run, the teller called the police. He and his granddaughter got cuffed and separated for questioning. /2
@rjjago @RBC @scotiabank @BMO @TD_Canada An artist from my community recently went into a BMO branch with his 12 y/o granddaughter. Context: Our Nation recently received settlement $ related to a case in the Supreme Court which was paid out to members. He presented his status card as ID. /1
@RBC Forget these quiz RBC....I am gonna close my account  from your SRBC(Scam Royal Bank Of Canada)....#AbsolutelyShitServices #ZeroCustomerHandling#ScammingCustomers
@RBC Yes RBC I made a new year resolution....I am gonna close my account  from your SRBC(Scam Royal Bank Of Canada)....#AbsolutelyShitServices #ZeroCustomerHandling
@RBCwealth Never ever #trust a bank that pays no interest on savings &amp; charges stupid fees on top of it, to tell you how to grow your money! Especially not @RBC @RBCwealth Like all banks all they care about is profits.
